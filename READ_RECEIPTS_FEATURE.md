# Message Info and Read Receipts Feature

## Overview
This feature adds WhatsApp-style read receipts and message info functionality to the Sanskrit Universal Chat application.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Firestore Schema Update
- Added `readBy` field to messages (Object): `{ "userId1": timestamp, "userId2": timestamp, ... }`
- Field is initialized as an empty object `{}` when a message is created

### 2. Read Status Tracking
- Uses **Intersection Observer API** to detect when messages enter the viewport
- Messages are automatically marked as read when:
  - Message is visible in the chat window (50% threshold)
  - Message was not sent by the current user
  - Message hasn't been marked as read by this user yet
- Read status is updated in Firestore using `updateDoc` with field path notation

### 3. Visual Indicators (Checkmarks)
- **Single checkmark (gray)**: Message delivered (sent successfully)
- **Double checkmark (gray)**: Read by at least one recipient
- **Double checkmark (blue)**: Read by all room participants
- Checkmarks only appear on messages sent by the current user

### 4. Message Info Popup
- Click on any message you sent to see detailed read receipt information
- Shows:
  - Original message text and Sanskrit translation
  - Sent timestamp
  - Delivery/read status
  - List of users who read the message with timestamps
  - User names and identifiers
- Modal can be closed by clicking the X button or clicking outside

### 5. Real-time Updates
- Uses existing Firestore `onSnapshot` listener for messages
- Read receipts update in real-time as users view messages
- No additional listeners needed

### 6. Privacy & Performance
- Only tracks read status for active messages in current room
- Efficient updates using Firestore field path notation
- Observer disconnects when leaving room to prevent memory leaks
- Batching not implemented to keep code simple (Firestore handles this efficiently)

## User Experience

### For Senders
1. Send a message in a chat room
2. See a single checkmark appear next to your message (delivered)
3. When recipients view your message, checkmark changes to double (read by some)
4. When all participants have read it, checkmark turns blue (read by all)
5. Click your message to see detailed read receipt information

### For Recipients
- Messages are automatically marked as read when scrolled into view
- No action needed from the user
- Read status updates happen seamlessly in the background

## Technical Notes

### Key Functions
- `markMessageAsRead(messageId)`: Updates Firestore with read status
- `setupMessageVisibilityObserver()`: Sets up Intersection Observer
- `getReadStatus(message)`: Determines read status (delivered/read-partial/read-all)
- `getReadStatusIcon(status)`: Returns appropriate checkmark icon HTML
- `showMessageInfo(message)`: Displays message info modal

### Integration Points
- Updated `translateAndSendMessage()` to include `readBy: {}` field
- Modified `renderChatMessages()` to add checkmarks and click handlers
- Enhanced `cleanupListeners()` to disconnect observer when leaving room
- Added new Lucide icons: `CheckCheck`, `X`, `Info`
- Added `updateDoc` import from Firebase Firestore

### Browser Compatibility
- Intersection Observer API is supported in all modern browsers
- Falls back gracefully if observer setup fails
- No external dependencies added

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add typing indicators
- [ ] Show "last seen" status for users
- [ ] Add option to disable read receipts (privacy setting)
- [ ] Batch read status updates for better performance with many messages
- [ ] Add sound/notification when message is read
