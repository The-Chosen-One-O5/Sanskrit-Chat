## Firebase Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Firestore Rules üî•

**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL** - Application won't work without this

- [ ] Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [ ] Select project: `sanskrit-chat`
- [ ] Navigate to: Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules tab
- [ ] Copy entire content of `firestore.rules` file
- [ ] Paste into Firebase Console rules editor
- [ ] Click **Publish** button
- [ ] Wait for confirmation message
- [ ] Verify rules appear in the Rules tab

**Verification**:
```
Check that Firebase Console shows:
- rules_version = '2'
- Match block for artifacts/{appId}/public/data/sanskrit_rooms
- Update rules for reactions and readBy fields
```

### 2. Verify Storage Rules (Already Deployed) üì¶

Storage rules should already be deployed from previous image upload fix. Verify:

- [ ] Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Rules tab
- [ ] Confirm rules from `storage.rules` are active
- [ ] Rules allow authenticated users to upload images
- [ ] If not deployed, copy `storage.rules` and publish

- [ ] Reactions remove successfully
- [ ] Real-time sync works
- [ ] No console errors

## Firebase Console Verification üîç

### Check Firestore Data Structure

- [ ] Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
- [ ] Navigate to: artifacts ‚Üí {appId} ‚Üí public ‚Üí data ‚Üí sanskrit_rooms ‚Üí {room-code} ‚Üí messages
- [ ] Open a message document with reactions
- [ ] Verify structure:
  ```
  {
    reactions: {
      "üëç": ["uid1", "uid2"],
      "‚ù§Ô∏è": ["uid3"]
    },
    readBy: {
      "uid2": Timestamp,
      "uid3": Timestamp
    }
  }
  ```

### Check for Rule Violations

- [ ] Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Usage tab
- [ ] Check for permission denied errors
- [ ] **Expected**: Zero permission denied errors after fix

### Check Rules Deployment

- [ ] Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules tab
- [ ] Confirm rules match `firestore.rules` file
- [ ] Check last deployment timestamp is recent

## Rollback Plan üîÑ

If critical issues are found:

### Option 1: Revert Rules (Quick)

- [ ] Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Rules
- [ ] Click "Rules History" button
- [ ] Select previous version
- [ ] Click "Restore"
- [ ] **Note**: Reactions will stop working but app won't break

### Option 2: Temporary Fix Rules

Deploy minimal rules that allow all authenticated updates:

```javascript
match /messages/{messageId} {
  allow read, create: if isAuthenticated();
  allow update: if isAuthenticated(); // Less restrictive
}
```

Then investigate and fix issues before deploying proper rules.

## Common Issues & Solutions üîß

### Issue: "Permission denied" still appearing

**Check**:
1. Are rules actually published? (Check Firebase Console)
2. Have rules propagated? (Wait 60 seconds)
3. Is user authenticated? (Check `auth.currentUser` in console)
4. Is `appId` variable correct? (Check console.log)

### Issue: Reactions work but don't sync

**Check**:
1. Real-time listener is attached (should be automatic)
2. Multiple tabs are in same room code
3. Network connection is stable
4. Check browser console for listener errors

### Issue: "Message not found" error

**Check**:
1. Message ID is being passed correctly
2. Message hasn't been deleted
3. Room code is correct
4. Firestore path is correct
