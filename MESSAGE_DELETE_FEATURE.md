# Message Hard Delete Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added the ability for users to permanently delete their own messages with a delete button in the message info popup. Messages completely disappear from chat for all users in real-time.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Functions Added (index.html)

#### `deleteMessage(messageId)` - Lines 1388-1424
- Async function that handles message deletion
- Shows browser confirmation dialog before deleting
- Implements loading state on delete button during operation
- Uses Firestore `deleteDoc()` to remove message from database
- Closes message info popup on successful deletion
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages:
  - Permission denied
  - Message not found
  - Network unavailable
- Re-enables button if deletion fails

#### `closeMessageInfoPopup()` - Lines 1426-1431
- Helper function to close the message info modal
- Used after successful deletion

### 2. Updated Functions

#### `showMessageInfo(message)` - Lines 1433-1545
- Added check: `const isMyMessage = message.userId === userId`
- Delete button only shows if message belongs to current user
- Handles both text messages and image messages:
  - Text messages: Shows original text and Sanskrit translation
  - Image messages: Shows thumbnail, filename, and file size
- Delete button styled with red background (destructive action indicator)
- Event listener attached to delete button calls `deleteMessage(message.id)`

### 3. Image Message Updates

#### Message Rendering (Lines 1874-1912)
- Added info icon button to image messages (for sender only)
- Icon allows users to open message info popup to access delete
- Positioned next to reaction trigger button
- Uses Lucide `info` icon with hover effect

#### Event Listeners (Lines 2015-2025)
- Added event listeners for `.message-info-trigger` buttons
- Clicking info icon opens message info popup with delete option
- Works seamlessly with existing reaction and image viewing functionality

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Delete Button Location
- Inside message info popup with read receipts
- Labeled "Delete Message" with trash icon 🗑️
- Red color (bg-red-500) to indicate destructive action
- Positioned at bottom of popup with border separator

### ✅ Permissions
- Delete button only visible for user's own messages
- Check: `message.userId === userId`
- Server-side enforcement via Firestore rules

### ✅ Hard Delete Implementation
- Browser confirmation dialog: "Delete this message? This cannot be undone."
- Loading state: Shows "⏳ Deleting..." while processing
- Uses `deleteDoc()` from Firestore SDK
- Path: `artifacts/{appId}/public/data/sanskrit_rooms/{roomId}/messages/{messageId}`
- Closes popup automatically on success

### ✅ Real-time Disappearance
- Existing Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners detect deletion automatically
- Message instantly disappears for all users in the room
- No "deleted" placeholder shown - message completely vanishes
- Message list re-renders smoothly without the deleted message

### ✅ Confirmation & Error Handling
- Native browser `confirm()` dialog for deletion confirmation
- Clear warning about permanent action
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Button re-enabled with retry option on error

### ✅ Image Message Support
- Info icon added to sender's image messages
- Clicking icon opens message info popup
- Delete button available in popup
- Deleting removes Firestore document (imgbb hosted image remains)

### ✅ Impact Handling
- Reactions data: Deleted with message (no orphaned data)
- Read receipts: Deleted with message
- Message count: Automatically decreases
- No broken references or dangling data

## Firestore Security Rules

The existing rules (firestore.rules, lines 53-56) already support message deletion:

```javascript
// Allow message sender to delete their own messages
allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && 
               resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
```

**No rule changes needed** - security is already properly configured!

## User Flow

### For Text Messages:
1. User clicks their own message bubble
2. Message info popup opens showing read receipts
3. Red "Delete Message" button appears at bottom
4. User clicks delete button
5. Confirmation dialog appears
6. User confirms deletion
7. Button shows "Deleting..." loading state
8. Message deleted from Firestore
9. Popup closes automatically
10. Message disappears for all users instantly

### For Image Messages:
1. User sees info icon (ℹ️) on their own image messages
2. User clicks info icon
3. Message info popup opens showing image details and read receipts
4. Red "Delete Message" button appears at bottom
5. Same flow as text messages (steps 4-10)

## Technical Details

### Delete Path
```
artifacts/{appId}/public/data/sanskrit_rooms/{roomId}/messages/{messageId}
```

### Security Check
```javascript
message.userId === userId  // Client-side
resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid  // Server-side
```

### Error Codes Handled
- `permission-denied`: User not authorized
- `not-found`: Message already deleted
- `unavailable`: Network connectivity issue

### Real-time Sync
Messages are listened to via:
```javascript
const messagesQuery = query(messagesRef, orderBy('timestamp', 'asc'));
onSnapshot(messagesQuery, (snapshot) => { ... });
```

When a message is deleted, the snapshot listener automatically removes it from the local `messages` array and triggers a re-render.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Deletion**: Delete own text message, verify it disappears
2. **Multi-user**: Have another user in room, verify they see deletion
3. **Image Deletion**: Delete image message via info icon
4. **Permission Test**: Verify button doesn't show for others' messages
5. **Error Handling**: Test with network offline, verify error message
6. **Confirmation**: Cancel deletion, verify message stays
7. **Already Deleted**: Delete message twice quickly, verify error handling

## Files Modified

- `index.html`: Added delete functionality (3 new functions, updated message rendering)
- `firestore.rules`: Already configured correctly (no changes needed)

## Deployment Notes

- No new dependencies required
- No environment variable changes needed
- Firestore security rules already deployed and correct
- Changes are backward compatible
- Feature works immediately upon deployment

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Delete imgbb hosted images (requires storing delete URLs)
- Undo deletion within X seconds
- Custom confirmation modal instead of browser dialog
- Batch delete multiple messages
- Admin override to delete any message
