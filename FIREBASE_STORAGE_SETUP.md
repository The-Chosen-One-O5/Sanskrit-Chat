# Firebase Storage Setup for Image Upload

## Issue: Image Upload Stuck/Infinite Loading

This document provides the complete setup guide and troubleshooting steps for fixing the image upload feature.

## Root Causes Addressed

1. **Incorrect Storage Bucket URL**: Changed from `sanskrit-chat.firebasestorage.app` to `sanskrit-chat.appspot.com`
2. **Missing Firebase Storage Rules**: Need proper security rules to allow authenticated users to upload
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Added comprehensive logging and error messages
4. **Silent Failures**: Added detailed console logging at every step of the upload process

## Required Firebase Storage Rules

The Firebase Storage security rules must be configured to allow authenticated users to upload images. Deploy the rules from `storage.rules` file to your Firebase project.

### How to Deploy Storage Rules:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `sanskrit-chat`
3. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click on the **Rules** tab
5. Copy and paste the rules from `storage.rules` file
6. Click **Publish** to deploy the rules

### Rules Overview:

```
- Authenticated users can read/write images in: /rooms/{roomCode}/images/
- Authenticated users can read/write thumbnails in: /rooms/{roomCode}/images/thumbnails/
- Maximum file size: 10MB for images, 2MB for thumbnails
- Only image content types allowed
```

## Code Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Storage Bucket URL
**File**: `index.html` (line 282)

**Before**: `storageBucket: "sanskrit-chat.firebasestorage.app"`

**After**: `storageBucket: "sanskrit-chat.appspot.com"`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Added comprehensive error handling in:
- `uploadImageMessage()` - Main upload function with detailed error codes
- `compressImage()` - Image compression with error logging
- `generateThumbnail()` - Thumbnail generation with error logging

### 3. Added Detailed Console Logging
Each stage of the upload process now logs to console:
- File selection and validation
- Compression start/completion with file sizes
- Thumbnail generation with dimensions
- Storage path creation
- Firebase Storage upload progress
- Download URL retrieval
- Firestore message creation

### 4. Pre-Upload Validation
Added checks for:
- Storage initialization status
- Current room code validity
- File type validation
- File size limits

## Debugging Steps

### Check Console for Detailed Logs

When uploading an image, check the browser console for detailed logs:

```
uploadImageMessage: Starting upload for file: image.jpg type: image/jpeg size: 123456
compressImage: Starting compression for: image.jpg
compressImage: Image loaded. Original dimensions: 1920 x 1080
compressImage: Canvas dimensions: 1920 x 1080
compressImage: Blob created successfully. Size: 98765
generateThumbnail: Starting thumbnail generation for: image.jpg
generateThumbnail: Image loaded. Original dimensions: 1920 x 1080
generateThumbnail: Thumbnail dimensions: 300 x 168
generateThumbnail: Thumbnail blob created successfully. Size: 12345
uploadImageMessage: Creating storage references...
uploadImageMessage: Image path: rooms/ABC123/images/1234567890-userId
uploadImageMessage: Uploading full image to Firebase Storage...
uploadImageMessage: Full image uploaded successfully
uploadImageMessage: Uploading thumbnail to Firebase Storage...
uploadImageMessage: Thumbnail uploaded successfully
uploadImageMessage: Getting download URLs...
uploadImageMessage: Full image URL: https://...
uploadImageMessage: Thumbnail URL: https://...
uploadImageMessage: Writing message to Firestore...
uploadImageMessage: Image uploaded and message saved successfully!
```

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### Error: `storage/unauthorized`
**Cause**: Firebase Storage rules don't allow the upload
**Solution**: Deploy the correct storage rules (see above)

#### Error: `storage/unknown`
**Cause**: Storage bucket not initialized or incorrect configuration
**Solution**: Check that `storageBucket` is set to `sanskrit-chat.appspot.com`

#### Error: `Failed to compress image`
**Cause**: Browser doesn't support Canvas API or image is corrupted
**Solution**: Try a different image or browser

#### Error: `Storage not initialized`
**Cause**: Firebase Storage failed to initialize
**Solution**: Check browser console for Firebase initialization errors

## Testing the Fix

### Test with Small Image First

1. Open the app in a browser
2. Open Developer Console (F12)
3. Join or create a chat room
4. Click the image upload button (blue icon)
5. Select a small image (< 100KB) in JPEG or PNG format
6. Watch the console for detailed logs
7. Image should appear in chat within a few seconds

### Verify in Firebase Console

1. Go to Firebase Console > Storage
2. Navigate to `rooms/{your-room-code}/images/`
3. You should see both the full image and thumbnail
4. Go to Firestore > artifacts > {appId} > public > data > sanskrit_rooms > {room-code} > messages
5. You should see a message document with `type: 'image'` and URLs

## Network Tab Analysis

If upload still fails, check the Network tab in Developer Tools:

1. Filter by "storage.googleapis.com"
2. Look for failed requests (red)
3. Check the response for error messages
4. Look for CORS errors or 403 Forbidden responses

## Firebase Configuration Verification

Ensure your Firebase config is correct:

```javascript
{
  projectId: "sanskrit-chat",
  storageBucket: "sanskrit-chat.appspot.com",  // Must be .appspot.com
  // ... other config
}
```
